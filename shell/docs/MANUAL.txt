Overview
========
MPI-Start is a set of scripts that allow the execution of MPI programs 
on clusters. The main advantage of MPI-Start is the possibility to 
detect and use site-specific configuration features - like the batch 
scheduler and the file system on the site. Also, different MPI 
implementations on a site are supported.
MPI-Start has a core which is always executed and uses the 
available frameworks at different stages of the execution. MPI-Start in 
its current version has three different frameworks:
-scheduler framework
-MPI framework
-file distribution framework

All of those frameworks use well-defined interfaces which allow
different plugins to be loaded and used for each framework.

The workflow of MPI-Start is as follows:
-check for scheduler plugin
-activate scheduler plugin
-get machinefile
-check for MPI plugin
-check I2G/EGEE environment
-parameter adjustments depending on scheduler/MPI
-activate MPI plugin and set MPI implementation specific parameters
-check user pre-run hooks
-check file system
-choose file distribution plugin if FS is non-shared
-distribute files using the file distribution plugin
-check for external MPI tools
-execute MPI application with generated command
-check user post-run hook
-check for external MPI tools
-clean up files using the file distribution plugin
-return the value of the mpirun/mpiexec command

====================
Scheduler framework
====================
Every plugin for this framework defines a method scheduler_available() 
which returns 0 if and only if the scheduler is available on the site. A 
second method scheduler_get_machinefile() sets the variable 
MPI_START_MACHINEFILE to point to the machine file. The format of this 
file has to be generic and if necessary the plugin has to guarantee 
that.
The assumption is that each site has exactly one scheduler. The 
first suitable scheduler is chosen.

Supported schedulers:
-SGE
-PBS
-LSF

=============
MPI framework
=============
Every plugin for MPI has  mpi_exec() and mpi_start() methods. 
mpi_start() is always called and calls a generic flow of running 
pre_run_hook/mpi_exec/post_run_hook. mpi_exec() is the 
MPI-implementation specific method of the plugin. It sets special 
parameters that are used to parametrize the generic_mpiexec() in the 
common /mpi directory.
This plugin is *not* automatically detected. The user or the broker 
must set I2G_MPI_TYPE to the MPI plugin.
